# CS-305

- Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
  - Artemis Financial is a consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for their customers. They are looking to incorporate additional security into their existing application.
- What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
  - What I did particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities is testing potential vulnerabilities in my code by static testing. Secure coding is important in order to protect your own information and as well as the users' using your application. Confidential information loss can cause great harm to both parties. Coding secure software helps to secure information and overall helps to protect a company’s reputation in the long run.
- What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
  - In the process of working through the vulnerability assessment the dependency check tool was the most helpful, it created a shortcut in detecting vulnerabilities verus than just checking each dependency by hand for vulnerabilities.
- How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
  - While testing out most of the vulnerabilities were caused by using old libraries, updating the libraries currently in use in the code then a more secure software will be created. Using penetration testing in the future will better assess the additional vulnerabilities within the code.
- How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
  - While coding the software, I ran debugs countlessly to ensure that it was functional and didn't cause any issues along the line. I ran another vulnerability test after refacotring the code to check if any new vulnerabilities were introduced.
- What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
  - I used stack overflow, youtube, guru when especially when running into errors in the console. They were extremely benifiical on assisting to solve the issues I receivied from the console.
- Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
  - One of my skills that I would demostrate to an employer is my use of a hash function to send encrypted communications back and forth.
